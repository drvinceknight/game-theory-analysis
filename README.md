Game Theory Analysis
====================

This repository is for testing and analyising the code written for Sage Mathematical Software which can be found (here)[https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory]


Our aim is for it to generate a random Normal Form Game. Then solve that game using 3 different methods; lrs, LCP and enumeration. From this we will record:
 - Date
 - Time
 - Size of Game
 - Payoff Matrix for Player1 and Player2
 - Ouput from lrs, LCP and enumeration
 - Time taken by lrs, LCP and enumeration
